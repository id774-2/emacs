The GNUstep port was made possible through the assistance of Adam
Fedor, Fred Kiefer, M. Uli Klusterer, Alexander Malmberg, Jonas
Matton, and Riccardo Mottola.  Leigh Smith maintained the SourceForge
project for a period.

Suggestions from Darcy Brockbank, Timothy Bissell, Scott Byer, David
Griffiths, Scott Hess, Eberhard Mandler, John C. Randolph, and Bradley
Taylor all helped things along at one point or another.  Axel Seibert
<seiberta@@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> and Paul J. Sanchez
<paul@@whimsy.umsl.edu> offered their time and machines to make a
binary release possible.

We would also like to thank a number of people who kept up the
constant supply of bug reports, suggested features and praise: Hardy
Mayer, Gisli Ottarsson, Anthony Heading, David Bau, Jamie Zawinski,
Martin Moncrieffe, Simson L. Garfinkel, Richard Stallman, Stephen
Anderson, Ivo Welch, Magnus Nordborg, Tom Epperly, Andreas Koenig,
Yves Arrouye, Anil Somayaji, Gregor Hoffleit; and the few hundred
other people on the mailing list from whom we didn't hear much, but
the presence of which assured us that maybe this project was actually
worth doing.
