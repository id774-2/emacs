Compilation
-----------

In the top-level directory, use:

  ./configure --with-ns

This will compile all the files, but emacs will not be able to be run except
in -nw (terminal) mode.

In order to run Emacs.app, you must run:

  make install

This will assemble the app in nextstep/Emacs.app.

If you pass the --disable-ns-self-contained option to configure, the lisp
files will be installed under whatever 'prefix' is set to (defaults to
/usr/local).  The bundle will be smaller, but depend on these resources (may
require 'sudo' for "make install").


Installation
------------

Move nextstep/Emacs.app to any desired install location.


Xcode
-----

On OS X Emacs can be built under Xcode.  You need to run "configure"
as described above first.  There are two targets: 'temacs' and 'Emacs.app'.

'temacs' will build the undumped emacs executable, and copy it and the
*.o files to the src directory.  These steps are necessary so the next target
works.

'Emacs.app' uses "Run Script" build phases to assemble the Emacs.app bundle.
It uses the 'ns-app' target in src/Makefile together with the 'install' target
in the top level Makefile.

The source files under the temacs target must list "pre-crt0" first
and "lastfile" last, so that dumping works.

(Note, under GNUstep, you CAN'T use ProjectCenter, since PC cannot work
with files outside of its project directory.)


Distributions and Universal Binaries
------------------------------------

Building as outlined above will create ordinary binaries running on your
architecture only.  To create universal binaries, set CFLAGS to include
"-arch ppc -arch i386".
