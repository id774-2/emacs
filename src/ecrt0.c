/* On the vax and 68000, in BSD4.2 and USG5.2,

  sp ->  word containing argc
         word pointing to first arg string
	 [word pointing to next arg string]... 0 or more times
	 0
Optionally:
	 [word pointing to environment variable]... 1 or more times

	 0

/*		********  WARNING ********
    Do not insert any data definitions before data_start!
    Since this is the first file linked, the address of the following
    variable should correspond to the start of initialized data space.
    On some systems this is a constant that is independent of the text
    size for shared executables.  On others, it is a function of the
    text size. In short, this seems to be the most portable way to
    discover the start of initialized data space dynamically at runtime,
    for either shared or unshared executables, on either swapping or
    virtual systems.  It only requires that the linker allocate objects
    in the order encountered, a reasonable model for most Unix systems.
    Similarly, note that the address of _start() should be the start
    of text space.   Fred Fish, UniSoft Systems Inc.  */
