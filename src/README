This directory contains the source files for the C component of GNU Emacs.
Nothing in this directory is needed for using Emacs once it is built
and installed, if the dumped Emacs (on Unix systems) is copied elsewhere.

See the files ../README and then ../INSTALL for installation instructions.

Under GNU and Unix systems, the file `Makefile.in' is used as a
template by the script `../configure' to produce `Makefile.c'.  The
same script then uses `cpp' to produce the machine-dependent
`Makefile' from `Makefile.c'; `Makefile' is the file which actually
controls the compilation of Emacs.  Most of this should work
transparently to the user; you should only need to run `../configure',
and then type `make'.
