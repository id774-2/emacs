;;; Commentary:

;; This Lisp code is run in Emacs when it is to operate as
;; a server for other processes.

;; Load this library and do M-x server-edit to enable Emacs as a server.
;; Emacs opens up a socket for communication with clients.  If there are no
;; client buffers to edit, server-edit acts like (switch-to-buffer
;; (other-buffer))

;; When some other program runs "the editor" to edit a file,
;; "the editor" can be the Emacs client program ../lib-src/emacsclient.
;; This program transmits the file names to Emacs through
;; the server subprocess, and Emacs visits them and lets you edit them.

;; Note that any number of clients may dispatch files to Emacs to be edited.

;; When you finish editing a Server buffer, again call server-edit
;; to mark that buffer as done for the client and switch to the next
;; Server buffer.  When all the buffers for a client have been edited
;; and exited with server-edit, the client "editor" will return
;; to the program that invoked it.

;; Your editing commands and Emacs's display output go to and from
;; the terminal in the usual way.  Thus, server operation is possible
;; only when Emacs can talk to the terminal at the time you invoke
;; the client.  This is possible in four cases:

;; 1. On a window system, where Emacs runs in one window and the
;; program that wants to use "the editor" runs in another.

;; 2. On a multi-terminal system, where Emacs runs on one terminal and the
;; program that wants to use "the editor" runs on another.

;; 3. When the program that wants to use "the editor" is running
;; as a subprocess of Emacs.

;; 4. On a system with job control, when Emacs is suspended, the program
;; that wants to use "the editor" will stop and display
;; "Waiting for Emacs...".  It can then be suspended, and Emacs can be
;; brought into the foreground for editing.  When done editing, Emacs is
;; suspended again, and the client program is brought into the foreground.

;; The buffer local variable "server-buffer-clients" lists
;; the clients who are waiting for this buffer to be edited.
;; The global variable "server-clients" lists all the waiting clients,
;; and which files are yet to be edited for each.

;; Todo:

;; - handle command-line-args-left.
;; - move most of the args processing and decision making from emacsclient.c
;;   to here.
;; - fix up handling of the client's environment (place it in the terminal?).

  "Process a request from the server to edit some files.
PROC is the server process.  STRING consists of a sequence of
commands prefixed by a dash.  Some commands have arguments;
these are &-quoted and need to be decoded by `server-unquote-arg'.
The filter parses and executes these commands.

To illustrate the protocol, here is an example command that
emacsclient sends to create a new X frame (note that the whole
sequence is sent on a single line):

	-env HOME=/home/lorentey
	-env DISPLAY=:0.0
	... lots of other -env commands
	-display :0.0
	-window-system

The following commands are accepted by the server:

`-auth AUTH-STRING'
  Authenticate the client using the secret authentication string
  AUTH-STRING.

`-env NAME=VALUE'
  An environment variable on the client side.

`-dir DIRNAME'
  The current working directory of the client process.

`-current-frame'
  Forbid the creation of new frames.

`-nowait'
  Request that the next frame created should not be
  associated with this client.

`-display DISPLAY'
  Set the display name to open X frames on.

`-position LINE[:COLUMN]'
  Go to the given line and column number
  in the next file opened.

`-file FILENAME'
  Load the given file in the current frame.

`-eval EXPR'
  Evaluate EXPR as a Lisp expression and return the
  result in -print commands.

`-window-system'
  Open a new X frame.

`-tty DEVICENAME TYPE'
  Open a new tty frame at the client.

`-suspend'
  Suspend this tty frame.  The client sends this string in
  response to SIGTSTP and SIGTTOU.  The server must cease all I/O
  on this tty until it gets a -resume command.

`-resume'
  Resume this tty frame.  The client sends this string when it
  gets the SIGCONT signal and it is the foreground process on its
  controlling tty.

`-ignore COMMENT'
  Do nothing, but put the comment in the server log.
  Useful for debugging.


The following commands are accepted by the client:

`-emacs-pid PID'
  Describes the process id of the Emacs process;
  used to forward window change signals to it.

`-window-system-unsupported'
  Signals that the server does not support creating X frames;
  the client must try again with a tty frame.

`-print STRING'
  Print STRING on stdout.  Used to send values
  returned by -eval.

`-error DESCRIPTION'
  Signal an error (but continue processing).

`-suspend'
  Suspend this terminal, i.e., stop the client process.
  Sent when the user presses C-z."
