README for Edition 3.0 of the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual.

* This directory contains the texinfo source files for the Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual.

* Report bugs in the Lisp Manual or in Emacs using M-x report-emacs-bug.
To ask questions, use the newsgroup gnu.emacs.help.

* The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual is quite large.  It totals around
1100 pages in smallbook format; the info files total around 3.0 megabytes.

* You can format this manual either for Info or for printing hardcopy
using TeX.

* You can buy nicely printed copies from the Free Software Foundation.
Buying a manual from the Free Software Foundation helps support our GNU
development work.  See <http://shop.fsf.org/>.

* The master file for formatting this manual for Tex is called
`elisp.texi'.  It contains @include commands to include all the
chapters that make up the manual.  In addition, `elisp.texi' has
the title page in a new format designed by Karl Berry, using the
@titlespec command.

* This distribution contains a Makefile that you can use with GNU Make.

** To create a DVI file with a sorted index, run `make elisp.dvi'.

** To make an Info file, you need to install Texinfo, then run `make info'.
