@appendix Emacs 22 Antinews
@c Update the emacs.texi Antinews menu entry with the above version number.

  For those users who live backwards in time, here is information
about downgrading to Emacs version 22.3.  We hope you will enjoy the
greater simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs
@value{EMACSVER} features.

@itemize @bullet

@item
We have switched to a character representation specially designed for
Emacs.  Rather than forcing all the widely used scripts into artificial
alignment, as Unicode does, Emacs treats them all equally, giving
each one a place in the space of character codes.  We have eliminated
the confusing practice, in Emacs 23, whereby one character can belong
to multiple character sets.  Now each script has its own variant, and
they all are different as far as Emacs is concerned.  For example,
there's a Latin-1 c-cedilla character, and there's a Latin-2
c-cedilla; searching a buffer for the Latin-1 variant only finds that
variant, but not the others.

@item
Emacs now uses its own special internal encoding for non-@acronym{ASCII}
characters, known as @samp{emacs-mule}.  This was imperative to
support several different variants of the same character, each one
belonging to its own script: @samp{emacs-mule} marks each character
with its script, to better discern them from one another.

@item
For simplicity, the functions @code{encode-coding-region} and
@code{decode-coding-region} no longer accept an argument saying where
to store the result of their conversions.  The result always replaces
the original, so there's no need to look for it elsewhere.

@item
Emacs no longer performs font anti-aliasing.  If your fonts look ugly,
try choosing a larger font and increasing the screen resolution.
Admittedly, this becomes difficult as you go further back in time,
since available screen resolutions will decrease.

@item
The Fontconfig font library is no longer supported.  To specify a
font, you must use an XLFD (X Logical Font Descriptor).  The other
ways of specifying fonts---so-called ``Fontconfig'' and ``GTK'' font
names---are redundant, so they have been removed.

@item
Transient Mark mode is now disabled by default.  Furthermore, some
commands that operate specifically on the region when it is active and
Transient Mark mode is enabled (such as @code{fill-paragraph}
@code{ispell-word}, and @code{indent-for-tab-command}), no longer do
so.

@item
Holding @key{shift} while typing a motion command no longer creates a
temporarily active region, since that's inconsistent with how Emacs
normally handles keybindings.  The variable @code{shift-select-mode}
has been deleted.  You can, however, still create temporarily active
regions by dragging the mouse.

@item
The line motion commands, @kbd{C-n} and @kbd{C-p}, now move by logical
text lines, not screen lines.  Even if a long text line is continued
over multiple screen lines, @kbd{C-n} and @kbd{C-p} treat it as a
single line, because that's ultimately what it is.

@item
Visual Line mode, which provides ``word wrap'' functionality, has been
removed.  You can still use Long Lines mode to gain an approximation
of word wrapping, though this has some drawbacks---for instance,
syntax highlighting often doesn't work well on wrapped lines.

@item
@kbd{C-l} now runs @code{recenter} instead of
@code{recenter-top-bottom}.  This always sets the current line at the
center of the window, instead of cycling through the center, top, and
bottom of the window on successive invocations.  This lets you type
@kbd{C-l C-l C-l C-l} to be @emph{absolutely sure} that you have
recentered the line.

@item
The way Emacs generates possible minibuffer completions is now much
simpler to understand.  It matches alternatives to the text before
point, ignoring the text after point; it also does not attempt to
perform partial completion if the first completion attempt fails.

@item
Typing @kbd{M-n} at the start of the minibuffer history list no longer
attempts to generate guesses of possible minibuffer input.  It instead
does the straightforward thing, by issuing the message @samp{End of
history; no default available}.

@item
Individual buffers can no longer display faces specially.  The text
scaling commands @kbd{C-x C-+}, @kbd{C-x C--}, and @kbd{C-x C-0} have
been removed, and so has the buffer face menu bound to
@kbd{S-down-mouse-1}.

@item
VC no longer supports fileset-based operations on distributed version
control systems (DVCSs) such as Arch, Bazaar, Subversion, Mercurial,
and Git.  For instance, multi-file commits will be performed by
committing one file at a time.  As you go further back in time, we
will remove DVCS support entirely, so you should migrate your projects
to CVS.

@item
Rmail now uses a special file format, Babyl format, specifically designed
for storing and editing mail.  When you visit a file in Rmail, or get new
mail, Rmail converts it automatically to Babyl format.

@item
Emacs can no longer display frames on X windows and text terminals
(ttys) simultaneously.  If you start Emacs as an X application, it
can only create X frames; if you start Emacs on a tty, it can only use
that tty.  No more confusion about which type of frame
@command{emacsclient} will use in any given Emacs session!

@item
Emacs can no longer be started as a daemon.  You can be sure that if
you don't see Emacs, then it's not running.

@item
Emacs has added support for many soon-to-be-non-obsolete platforms,
including VMS, DECstation, SCO Unix, and systems lacking alloca.
Support for Sun windows has been added.

@item
To keep up with decreasing computer memory capacity and disk space, many
other functions and files have been eliminated in Emacs 22.3.
